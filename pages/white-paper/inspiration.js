                Before a great project comes to fruition, great inspiration must
                precede it. When deciding on what to call our passionate
                project, we had at least a hundred ideas. At first, we couldnâ€™t
                decide. but after team discussion, we followed our passion, it
                is MOBA games and Ancient Egyptian civilization, it only made
                sense to come up with a name and image which encompassed the
                feel of the great games that inspired us. League of Pharaohs was
                the name we chose. It encapsulated the essence of our
                inspirations while maintaining a new, yet familiar identity of
                its own.
